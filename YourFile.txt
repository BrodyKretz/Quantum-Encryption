In the 1960â€™s the Black Arts Movement was created in order to support the black power movement whose goal was to bring awareness to the changing political and cultural climate of that time towards people of color. The whole movement lasted through the 1960s to the 1970s. One of the supporters, Leroi Jones(otherwise known as Amiri Baraka after his name change) , established the Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School after  Malcolm X was assassinated. Amiri Baraka is known to be the father of the balck arts movement, and he established the Black Arts Repertory Theatre School (BART/S) in Harlem. His example inspired other people who participated in the movement to create more organizations like his. Although the movement was male dominated, there were several black women that emerged from the movement including Nikki Giovanni, Sonia Sanchez, Ntozake Shange, Audre Lorde, June Jordan, and more.
